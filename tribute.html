                <p>Christopher Henry Gayle OD (born 21 September 1979) is a Jamaican cricketer who has been playing international cricket
                for the West Indies since 1999.[5] Nicknamed "The Universe Boss", Gayle is widely regarded as one of the greatest and
                most destructive batsmen to have played Twenty20 cricket, and by some as the best ever. [6][7] He played a crucial role
                in the West Indies teams that won the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, 2012 ICC World Twenty20 and 2016 ICC World Twenty20. He
                was a good ODI and Test batter as well.
                
                He has set numerous records across all three formats of the game. He is the most capped player for the West Indies in
                international cricket and is the only player to score a triplet of centuries â€“ a triple hundred in Tests, double hundred
                in ODIs and a hundred in T20Is. Gayle is the only player to score more than 14,000 runs and hit more than 1,000 sixes in
                T20 cricket[8][9] He is also the leading run scorer for West Indies in both ODIs and T20Is and along with Brian Lara the
                only player to score more than 10,000 runs for West Indies in ODI Cricket. Gayle was the first West Indian batsman to
                score a double-century in ODI cricket and subsequently in the history of World Cup cricket, where he scored an innings
                of 215 against Zimbabwe. His innings of 215 is currently the highest individual score by a left-handed batsman in ODI
                cricket. Along with the ODI record, he has the highest individual score in the T20 World Cup as a West Indian with his
                117 runs against South Africa. Moreover, in the ICC Champions Trophy, he has the highest score made by a West Indian
                with his innings of 133 not out against South Africa in the 2006 tournament. In addition to his batting, He has picked
                up over 200 International Wickets with his Right-arm off-break spin bowling. He was awarded the Most Valuable Player in
                the 2011 Indian Premier League and held the Orange Cap in 2012. <br></p>

                <strong><u> EARLY LIFE</u></strong><br>
                He eventually made his first-class debut in 1998, at age 19 for Jamaica. He played his first One Day International
                eleven months later in 1999, and his first Test match six months after that. Gayle went on to establish himself as a
                destructive batsman who's most effective whilst playing square of the wicket.
                <br><br>
                <strong><u>CARRIER</u></strong><br>
                Gayle started his cricket career with Lucas Cricket Club in Kingston, Jamaica.[13] Gayle claimed: "If it was not for
                Lucas, I don't know where I would be today. Maybe on the streets."[13] Lucas Cricket Club's nursery has been named in
                honour of Gayle.[13]
                
                He was made captain of the West Indies side in the ICC T20 World Cup 2009 after getting criticized for playing in the
                IPL 2008 and missing an international series a few months before. Gayle scored a quickfire 88 in the opening game of the
                tournament and helped the Windies beat the mighty Australians. They lost in the semi-final to Sri Lanka.
